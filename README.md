# Welcome to Message Novel

Message Novel an open source Remix React project built with Vite and a Supabase Backend. 
To try out the website please visit [Message Novel](https://messagenovel.vercel.app/) by clicking the link.

## Key concepts

For a user, CRUD your way through making your own novella either by yourself or with collaboration. Built using Lexical JS and utilitzing Liveblocks for collobration, Message Novel should feel inuitive and invite chatter. Whether that be through comments or actual contributions to the story.

As a developer, Message novel is: 

- An Experiment in the limitations of TailwindCSS and Remix Run.
- A full stack set up of a Postgres database that utilizes webhooks to talk to Liveblocks
- Using a blender file with Three JS to show off some Jazzy scenary
- Expression of love for Lexical JS
- Deploy with Vercel CI/CD 

## Limitations of Remix

Remix is a create library alternative to Next.JS especially in terms of Routing through ```<Outlet />```
However, ```loader``` and ```action``` pose some serious limits. The fact that you will need to call a new instance of Supabase within each route leads to unnecessary API calls and worse duplicate data.

Whilst this can be broken down in places, in others its unavoidable.

## Limitations of Tailwind CSS

There is none... its purely a skill issue... Look at Tailwind.css file. That is an illustration of places that I could not get to work. Lexical requires all elements only have 1 className and thus I had to make special conditons to overcome this issue

## Issues with Lexical

Collobration Plugin references documnent and so we have to use a mount hook to avoid it rendering on server. Furthermore, trying to find out a way to convert editorState to yjs update was very painful.

## Limitations with Supabase and Lexical

Currently there is no offical provider for Lexical and Supabase. Whilst I did try to use ```https://github.com/AlexDunmow/y-supabase``` this was very limiting and buggy. In the end I ported all the collobration elements (pages) to Liveblocks.

## Database and Env Setup
You will need to set up 2 different databases (Supabase and Liveblocks). The instructions for adding Supabase tables are below. Once both Supabse and Liveblocks accounts are set up make a new env file in the root directory and add the following keys

-- SUPABASE_URL
-- SUPABASE_KEY
-- SUPABASE_IMG_STORAGE
-- SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY
-- LIVEBLOCKS_PUBLIC_KEY
-- LIVEBLOCKS_SECRET_KEY

The Supabase Img Storage value is the following 'SUPABASE_URL' + '/storage/v1/object/'

## Supabase Database Setup

To set up tables and storage in Supabase please copy and paste the following commands into the SQL Editor. Please do it in order due to how dropping tables for updates work. 

!! important please enable webhooks before doing any of this.
Also remove email authentication requirements. (Authentication > Providers > Email > Confirm Email: false)
